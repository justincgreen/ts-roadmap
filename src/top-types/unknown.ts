/*
  Unknown
  unknown is the type-safe counterpart of any. Anything is assignable to unknown, but unknown isnâ€™t assignable to anything but itself and any without a type assertion or a control flow based narrowing. Likewise, no operations are permitted on an unknown without first asserting or narrowing to a more specific type.
